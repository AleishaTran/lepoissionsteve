# AI in Robotics: Autonomous Pac-Man Player

This repository contains the code and resources for our project in the *Artificial Intelligence in Robotics* course. The goal of this project is to train an AI model that can autonomously play and win the classic retro game **Pac-Man**.

## Project Overview

We use a Python implementation of Pac-Man combined with machine learning techniques to train an agent capable of navigating the maze, avoiding ghosts, and maximizing the score without human intervention.

## Key Features

- Custom OpenAI Gym environment based on Pac-Man
- Reinforcement learning models to learn optimal gameplay strategies
- Training scripts and evaluation tools to measure AI performance
- Visualization of game states and AI decisions

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies (e.g., Pygame, Gym, PyTorch)
3. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train_pacman.py
